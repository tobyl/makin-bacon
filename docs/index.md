<h2>Why make your own bacon?</h2>

<p>For the lifelong bacon fans among us, the journey to homemade bacon is probably very similar. You've been buying from the supermaket, but over the years you notice that the quality has gradually dropped, slices are thinner and less meaty, and prices have steadily risen.</p>

<p>You may have rejoiced when "extra thick cut" bacon became a more common (albeit pricier) option, only to be disappointed after a few months when the quality dropped there too.</p>

<p>Or you might be someone who enjoys making their own food and taking control over what you eat.</p>

<p>The great news is that making your own bacon is <strong>CHEAP</strong>, <strong>EASY</strong> and very safe if you follow some simple rules!</p>
