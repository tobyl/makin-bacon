</li>
<li>
<h4>Sugar</h4>

<h4>Jumbo Plastic Bags</h4>

</ul>

### Very helpful

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>
<h4>Digital Scale</h4>
This item could be considered "necessary", especially if using what's called the EQ curing method.  A scale with a gram reading to the tenth or even hundredths works best. 
</li>
<li>
<h4>Cooling Rack</h4>
A cooling rack can be used on top of a large cookie sheet when the meat is placed in the refrigerator during different times in the curing process. This can help generate good airflow. 
</li>
<li>
<h4>Food Vacuum Sealer</h4>
Vacuum sealers are a great way to store your bacon, especially if you plan to freeze.  They can be used on a variety of different foods and can prolong the freshness of your product. 
</li>

<h4>Electric Meat Slicer</h4>
A sharp knife can work fine when cutting bacon, however, a nice meat slicer can make this task much easier. They come in a variety of different styles and price ranges. 
</li>
<li>
<h4>Additional Spices</h4>
After your basic ingredients of salt, sugar, and cure, you may want to add additional spices and ingredients to create new flavor profiles. (Be careful when adding additional salty ingredients, however.
