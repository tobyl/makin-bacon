## High level goals for the site

From a technical perspective, the high level site goals are:

- Be accessible to all users
- Mobile-friendly - display correctly on mobile and larger screens
- Works on light and dark mode

From a content perspective, the high level site goals are:

- Offer beginners a guide to the process, with strong resources and helpful information
- Offer resources to more advanced users, such as recipes and equipment and process guides
- Ensure that all users understand the pros and cons (and risks) involved

## Building this site yourself

If you would like to build the site yourself, you should be able to do so quite easily.

Core technologies:

- Jekyll (static site generator)
- Ruby (minimal knowledge, the language Jekyll is built with)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- NPM or Yarn to build the Tailwind stylesheet

Clone down this repo, make sure you have Ruby installed. To run the site locally, run:

```
bin/dev
```

Which will run Jekyll and the Tailwind server.
